# Best Practices
1. Use a strong password
2. Don't backup `gocryptfs.conf` to public storage
3. DO backup `gocryptfs.diriv` along with your encrypted files

`man gocryptfs` is your friend.

# Standard Mode
# the cipher folder should be inside the Dropbox folder 
# but the plain folder should be outside! Example:

mkdir ~/Dropbox/cipher
mkdir ~/plain
gocryptfs -init ~/Dropbox/cipher
gocryptfs ~/Dropbox/cipher ~/plain

---

# Reverse Mode
# The following shows an example of user archie creating a backup of /home/archie
gocryptfs -init -reverse /home/archie
#Second, an empty directory for the encrypted view of the home directory is created and mounted
mkdir /tmp/crypt
gocryptfs -reverse /home/archie /tmp/crypt
# Third, archie creates a backup of the encrypted directory, a simple local copy for this example
cp -a /tmp/crypt /tmp/backup
# The encrypted directory can stay mounted for the user session, or be unmounted manually
fusermount -u /tmp/crypt
rmdir /tmp/crypt

 ---

# Reverse Mode - Restore
# using the archie example above
mkdir /tmp/restore
gocryptfs /tmp/backup/ /tmp/restore
